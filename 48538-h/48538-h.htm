<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>——<i>Room in</i> <span class="charname">Royal Manning’s</span> <i>home. Doors</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>, <i>open
to garden; long window in flat</i>; <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, <i>with curtains, draped
back, stand of flowers before it; upright piano against
flat</i>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, <i>of door, at which</i> <span class="charname">Bessie</span> <i>is seated, playing, back to
audience. Mantel</i>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, <i>with fireplace.</i> <span class="charname">Royal</span> <i>standing in
chair hanging a sabre</i> (<i>sheathed</i>) <i>above the mantel. Table</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.,
C.</span>, <span class="charname">May</span> <i>seated</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>of it, sewing. Chair</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>of table, hassock
near it; ottoman back near window. Doors</i> 1 <i>and</i> 3 <i>entrance</i>
<span class="allsmcap">R.</span>; <i>door 2d entrance</i>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>Flowers in vase on mantel;
whole scene tasty and comfortable. Music at rising of
curtain,——“The Dearest Spot on Earth to me is Home,
Sweet Home!”</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Royal.</span></span> There, May, we’ll hang this relic of my warrior
days above the mantel, to remind us, that now I have become
a husband, the sword is beaten into a ploughshare.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Very appropriate, now you have become a husbandman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Good, very good! Wedlock has sharpened your
wits. Yes, I am the happy husband of the best little wife
ever erring man was blessed with. Oh, blissful state of
matrimony! why did I not become your naturalized citizen
before? (<i>Steps from chair</i>). There, old friend, rest in peace!
no more shall we in fellowship dash upon the enemy; no
more, hand in hand, encounter the perils of the battlefield,
the glory of triumph, the shame of defeat. Oh, rest in peace,
old dog of war, until you grow rusty with honorable age!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> How very pathetic! You have pronounced the
eulogy. Bess, a dirge would be appropriate just now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Yes. How would “Old Dog Tray” suit the
occasion?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Very bad. A biting sarcasm (<i>Looks at sabre</i>).
Rather ornamental. Hey, May? (<i>Sits in chair</i>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>of table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> It has a wicked look. It makes me shudder.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Indeed! then down it comes. (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> No, let it hang. I only fear that, like its master,
it may occasionally have martial fits, and then——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Fits! Well, what then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> My poor vases would fall beneath the sword.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Never fear; like its master, ’tis securely tied to
your apron-string. How time flies! ’Tis ten years since my
old friend and I closed our campaign.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> And just three months since we closed our campaign——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Of courtship, yes, and massed our forces for the
battle of life. Yes, yes. Then I captured the heart, which,
for two years, I had so valiantly attacked.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Valiantly, indeed. ’Twas with fear and trembling,
you, the veteran warrior, approached the citadel.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Which was longing to surrender.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> No; I’ll not confess that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> But you do not regret it, May? You are happy
here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Happy, Roy? I never dared to dream of so much
happiness. I, a poor sewing-girl, earning my living with the
needle, have now a home any lady might well be proud of,
and a husband——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Ahem!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>rising</i>).</span> Hallo! Little Pitcher’s ears are wide open.
(<i>Crossing to mantel, and leaning against it</i>). What’s the matter,
Bess?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess</span> (<i>swinging round on stool</i>).</span> Can’t you speak a little
louder, you two? It’s so provoking to only hear the ripple of
a conversation which you know will be sure to end in a
smacking breeze.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> I was not within saluting distance. (<i>Aside.</i>) I wish
I had been.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Then I should have had a full report of your conversation.
Ha! ha! ha! you two have been married three
months, and have not yet finished your courting. Remarkable
vitality! I thought love-making ended at the altar.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Remarkable ignorance, Bess. But you are young
and green. Did you, indeed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Yes; and that the flame of love was extinguished
when the husband, poor man! was obliged to rise, on a cold,
frosty morning, to build the fire.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> That only adds fuel to the flame.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> That the fountain of affection ceased to flow,
when he had to go a mile to draw a pail of water.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Liquid nonsense. You are alluding, of course,
now, chatterbox, to our first effort at housekeeping; but
all that is over; everything is nicely arranged, and we can
now bask in the warmth of domestic fires.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> If the chimney doesn’t smoke,——which it does,
you know, awfully.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>crossing to chair</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>of table</i>).</span> Hang the chimney!
You’d put a damper on anything. May, what shall we do with
this girl?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Let her scoff. It will be our turn soon; her fate
is approaching.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess</span> (<i>jumping up</i>).</span> Did you hear his step?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<div class="poetry">
 <div class="verse">“By the pricking of my thumbs,</div>
 <div class="verse">Something wicked this way comes.”</div>
</div>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> It’s Marcus, and you have told me. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Stop! stop! Bess! I hear nothing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Let her go; no doubt she’ll meet Marcus, and,
having found him, she’ll <i>mark-us</i> no more. Do you know,
May, I’m getting anxious about that young man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> He’s a very agreeable fellow, seems honest, and is
fast winning the affections of Bess.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Yes, I know all that you know; but what we don’t
know is what bothers me. When, in pursuit of happiness, I
made my way to the humble but comfortable residence of
the late Mrs. Bradley, you being the attraction, I found this
young man paying court to Bess in the parlor, while I
emulated his example by making love to you in the sitting-room.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> They were well called suite (<i>soot</i>) er rooms, ha!
ha! ha!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Allow me to correct your pronunciation for suite
(<i>sweet</i>) er, rooms, they must have been, with two pair of
lovers. Well, Mrs. Bradley died. You must have a home;
there was nothing to hinder, and we were married, came here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and brought Bess with us, a welcome addition to our household.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Dear girl! She is the light of our house.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Well, I cannot exactly agree with you, having a
star of the first magnitude before my eyes. As a matter of
course, Mr. Marcus Graves follows. I don’t object to that,
but I do object to his secretiveness. Who is he? He
seems to have no relatives, no friends: at least he never
speaks of them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> You know his business?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Yes. He’s a drummer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> A military man. Then you surely should like
him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> A military man——not exactly, our military drummer——musters
his men to battle with the rattle of his sheepskin;
your civil drummer, with the rattle of his tongue, taps
the sheepskin of the men he musters, and too often makes
enemies in his own ranks, with short and poor rations not
up to sample. Yes; I have become the natural protector
of this young lady, and should know something about this
ardent suitor who never speaks of marriage.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> To be sure you should. Well, why don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname"><a name="tn_8_Roy"></a>Roy.</span></span> What! Pin him in a corner, and, like a stern parent,
ask him who are his parents, and what are his intentions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> And what then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Ten to one he’ll fly into a passion, tell me it’s none
of my business, and quit the house in disgust.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Somehow, Roy, I have faith in Marcus Graves.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Because Bessie loves him. Oh, the warm cloak of
affection covers a multitude of sins!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> For the world I would not bring a pang to her
dear heart! Her mother, for fifteen years, was the dearest
friend I had in the world. When the war broke out, my
father went to battle. We were all in the West then. What
ever became of him I never knew. No doubt he died for
his country as bravely as he went forth. My mother——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Deserted you! Fled with your father’s friend!
It’s a sad story, May. Don’t speak of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Yes: I was left to the care of strangers. And
this kind neighbor, Mrs. Bradley, took pity upon me. She
was poor; but, hard as was her lot, I was treated as her own
child. O Roy! she was a mother to the friendless little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
stranger! Heaven knows I am grateful! All the tenderness
she bestowed upon me I have tried to repay in love for her
child. In days of poverty, Bess and I shared our crusts together;
and now that fortune has blessed me with prosperity,
her happiness is more than ever, with your dear help, to be
the aim of my life. Comrades in adversity should be comrades
in prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Right, Mary. For her happiness we will strive together.
Comrades! ah, that brings back the old days, May!
But I forget; you do not like to have me speak of them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> You do not mean that, Roy. Am I not proud of
your war record? Do I not glory in your triumphs, there
where brave men fought and fell.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> That old sabre, if it had a tongue, could tell wondrous
stories. Ah! old fellow! you failed me once. In
those old days I had a friendship for a man in our regiment,
with whom I made a queer compact, something after the
manner of yours and Bessie’s. He saved my life one day.
’Twas at Antietam, we were swooping down upon the enemy,——a
cloud of horsemen with flashing sabres. Just as we
reached the foe, my horse stumbled and fell. I thought my
time had come. But between me and a descending sabre
rode my comrade. I was saved. That night in camp we
renewed our friendship, and, in jovial mood, vowed that
whatever good fortune should be in store for us in the future
should be shared between us. We were both poor——nothing
but our soldier’s pay. The war ending, we parted. He went
West in search of friends. I come here, to find my only
friend, my father, dead, and, to my surprise, a small fortune
awaiting me. Poor fellow! I often wonder if he fared as
well. (<i>Rises, goes</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> And you have not seen him since?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> No: one of these days I mean to hunt him up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> To share with him your fortune?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span></span> (<i>comes to back of her chair, hand on table; looks
at her</i>). If he be poor, yes; for I shall still be rich. He
could not claim my chief treasure, my pearl above price,——you
(<i>stoops to kiss her</i>).</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Bess</i>, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Ahem!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>starting up, and crossing to</i> <span class="allsmcap">R</span>).</span> Bother that girl!
Well, what now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> I smell smoke, and where there’s smoke there
must be fire.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Not where you are. You’re a capital extinguisher.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Did you find him, Bess?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> No. ’Twas a false alarm. Oh, dear! why don’t
he come?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Poor dear! how sad! Hasn’t seen him since last
night——no, this morning; for I’ll be hanged if the sun
wasn’t rising when I got up to fasten the door after him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Yes, your father’s son. What a shame——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> <a name="tn_10_Youre"></a>You’re right. I nearly caught my death.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> To talk so! You know he left the house before
ten.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> This morning, yes. Quite time to be moving.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Roy, don’t torment her. See how anxious she is!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> As anxious as a cat to seize a poor little mouse,
that she may tease it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Oh, you wicked wretch! You know we never
quarrel. (<i>Goes</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Oh, here you are, Manning! Call your chickens
under their mother’s wing; fasten up the hen-roost; barricade
your pigpen; call out your troops, and plant your biggest
guns upon the ramparts. The enemy is at your door!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Halloa! Halloa! What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Enemy! what enemy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Marcus, have you been drinking?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> I told you he was up late. Well, old fellow, who is
the enemy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> The terror of housekeepers! the devourer of cold
meats! the robber of the clothes-line! Hush! “take heed!
whisper low”——the tramp.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Ah!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Indeed!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Yes. I met a true type of the fraternity half a
mile below. He stopped my horse, and begged money. I
always make short work of these fellows, so tossed him a
quarter and rode on. He turned into that shanty set apart
for the entertainment of man and beast, and no doubt will
pour entertainment down his throat in beastly style. So
look out, Manning. He may pay you a visit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> ’Twill be a short one, then; and I’ll give him no
quarter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Well, how are you all, particularly my bonny Bess?
(<i>Shakes hands with her</i>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Half a mile below. Did he look rough?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Rough, but good-natured. Dress ragged, face
bloated, figure plump. These fellows thrive on their pickings
these pests.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Don’t say that, Marcus. The fellow may have
been unfortunate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Unfortunate? Bah! What’s misfortune but a roll
in the dust?——jump up, shake yourself, and you’re as good
as new. I’ve no patience with a man who wants vim——something
on the side of his face——you know——cheek!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Yes: a quality which tramps (<i>aside</i>) and drummers
(<i>aloud</i>) possess in a wonderful degree. (<span class="charname">Bess</span> <i>goes up
to piano.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> For my part, I never allow myself to be staggered
by the blows of fate. When they come, I take a long breath,
and hit out straight from the shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> When did you hear from your father, Mr. Graves?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar</span> (<i>confused</i>).</span> Eh,——my fa——yes——oh, yes! That is——not
lately.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> He was well when you heard?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Oh, yes, beautiful——that is hearty——he wishes to
be remembered to all my customers——my friends, I mean.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Goes up to piano.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>coming to table</i>).</span> May, what are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Pinning him in a corner. You men are so afraid
of each other. Woman’s curiosity knows no fear. We’ve
found out one thing: he has a father.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Yes, and one other: he’s afraid of him. Did you
notice his hesitation?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Yes. There’s some mystery about that father,
which I mean to fathom.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> But not now; give him time. You staggered him——after
his boast, too. He didn’t strike out well. Come,
let’s go into the garden. The young people want to be left
alone. (<i>Goes up.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Graves</span> (<i>slowly</i>).</span> Now what possessed Mrs. Manning to

(<span class="charname">Bess</span> <i>tickles his ear with the wisp. He brushes it off

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Dreaming, Marcus? (<i>Sits on hassock at his feet,

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Why, Bess, what a brute I’ve been! Yes, dreaming,
Bess, of a happy future, I trust, in store for you and me.
Do you ever dream of that time?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Not I. When the skies are bright above us, why
should we seek to peep even in dreams beneath the horizon
when we know not what storms may be gathering there to
roll over the brightness of the present?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Yes; but the cautious mariner is ever alert for the

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Well, I am not a mariner, and my umbrella is

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Bess, can’t you be serious?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> I don’t know. Try me.</p>

three years we have been all in all to each other; and now,
Bess, I tell you I am unworthy of your love.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> You, Marcus! Now, you surprise me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> You trust me fully? You would go with me to the

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> To death itself, Marcus!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> And yet, on my part, <a name="tn_13_there"></a>there has been no confidence;
into my past life you have had no glimpse. You took me, a
stranger, to your heart,——never questioned me; and, beyond
the interchange of affection, myself, my fortune, and my home
are strangers still.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Blind, Marcus! Blind, are you? My woman’s
curiosity sought in the beginning to know you; my heart’s
instinct probed you, to know if you were worthy. I found
you polite, chivalrous, charitable, with a heart open to every
cry of distress, a hand ever ready to proffer assistance.
Oh, I tried you deeply, as your purse can show! I found
you true, noble, sincere. I had no right to question further.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> But you must know me, Bess.</p>

worker in the confectionery <a name="tn_16_business"></a>business. (<i>Takes box from left

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> No. Confectionery, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>puts back paper</i>).</span> Nancy, the first time I ever

beauty——try a peppermint. (<i>Takes paper from his pocket
and offers it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>folding her arms and turning her head</i>).</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>puts back paper</i>).</span> I was a butcher,——an honest
but bloody butcher. You turned up your nose at the scent
of blood.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Because I knew you wouldn’t stick to it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> I turned my back upon the slaughtered beeves,
and in that higher sphere, the milky way, sought to win your
love. You politely but firmly assured me I couldn’t <i>comet</i>
in that line.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> I detest the whole race! Milk and water men!
I’d like to scald them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Cremation would suit them better. My next
venture was in the slippery walks of butter and cheese.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Anything but a butter man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> So I found out, when I attempted to slide into
your affections in that role. You told me to cheese it. I understood
you, and I sought a higher sphere. I embarked in
the electric line, and went out into the highways and by-ways
to introduce lightning-rods.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Well, I found no fault with that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> No; but I did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Why didn’t you stick to it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Well, Nancy, (<i>takes box from breast pocket</i>).
Have a little taffee?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>puts paper back</i>).</span> The fact is, lightning-rods don’t
agree with me. I started out in high hopes, one bright
morning, espied an unprotected dwelling, rushed boldly up,
rung the bell, notwithstanding a gigantic mastiff lay at my
feet, evidently occupied in catching flies. Gent came to the
door. In glowing speech I introduced my business. He
rubbed his chin, said, “I don’t know,” and looked at the
dog. I found he did know, when he further remarked, with
emphasis, “Rover, here’s another rod man.” The dog gave
a growl and rose. An electric shock was communicated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
my being, and I calculated in one brief minute how many
rods I should have to clear before reaching my rods outside.
Then I left, closely attended by the dog. I didn’t own these
clothes then; if I had my loss would have been greater,
especially in that part of my wardrobe which the artist designated
as <i>tout ensemble</i>. I gave up that business in disgust.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Well, what next?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Then I sought the confectioner’s emporium.
Said I, here’s a sweet occupation, and a candid young man
can win more lasses’ favor in this line than in any other.
Nancy, you would adore me could you see me in a white
apron, pulling molasses candy over a hook (<i>with gestures</i>),
with a long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull altogether!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Simon Stone, you are a fool!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Nancy, I know it, or I should not be running
after you, when I’ve been snubbed time and time again.
Nancy, dear Nancy, look upon me with favor this time.
(<i>Takes box from pocket behind.</i>) Accept this slight but
sweet offering of affection. (<i>Presents it.</i>) Real French
candy——made it myself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>taking box</i>).</span> Do you mean to stick to this business,
Simon?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> To be sure I do, and it’s an awful sticky business
I tell you——specially setting down into a pan of hot, cooling
candy when you aren’t particularly tired.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Well, Simon, if I thought I could trust you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> You can, Nancy, you can. O Nancy, quit this
scrubbing existence and work for me alone!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> I’ll think about it when you find the soap.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> I have found it in the confectionery line.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Do you Nancy. Eurekey, I’ve found it at last!
(<i>Takes paper from <a name="tn_17_pants"></a>pants pocket.</i>) Try a chocolate drop,
Nancy. (<i>She takes it.</i>) You make me so happy. It’s just
the nicest business you ever looked upon. Rows and rows
of shelves filled with all that’s sweet to the tooth——and
profitable to the dentist. And then the girls, Nancy, you
should see the girls.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> The what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Girls. Pretty girls that tend behind the counters,
dealing out sugar plums, and——and lozengers, and——and
kisses, with eyes full of fun and mouths full of candy.
Oh, it’s just glorious! Ha! ha! ha!</p>

a sweet thing left in the sugar and molasses line, and I don’t
mean to give it up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Go back to your sweet things, your pretty
waiter girls. Go, sir!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> I will, you cruel, heartless, scrubby thing! and if

I am innocent of crime. Five years ago I was employed in
a house in Chicago as book-keeper. A large sum of money
was found missing, and I alone had access to it. I was
arrested, and placed in the prisoner’s dock. No proofs
could be found to convict me, so I was discharged. I was
innocent. The cunning rogue had so covered his tracks
that the real culprit could not be detected. I was requested
to resign my situation, which I did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> And you took no steps to make your innocence
clear?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Unfortunately, no. I knew I was innocent, and,
anxious to keep the matter from my father, Hon. Lucius
Graves, of Wisconsin, I came East, hoping that in time my
innocence would be admitted, and I should be recalled.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> And your father?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> Believes I am still in Chicago.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> And without a word of explanation, with this stigma
upon your character, you have won the affections of an
inmate of my household? Mr. Graves, I am a just man;
when you can clearly prove your innocence, you will be
welcome. Until then, my doors are no longer open to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> O Roy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> He is innocent; I know he is innocent!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Let him be proved so, and no one will give him
warmer greeting. But when a man’s character is attacked,
to turn his back upon the enemy and fly without striking one
blow for his reputation is a mark of cowardice which no
soldier can pardon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Mar.</span></span> I understand you, sir; and, bitter as are your
words, I thank you for them. You have shown me my duty.
Bess, darling, be of good heart. I will return to claim you.
You know I am innocent; but I will not appear until the
world shall know the truth. Farewell!</p>

here, six months ago, a drunken tramp; and now he’s as

jolly and pleasant, too. And so eager to help, one can’t help

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> No, Nancy; the saccharine and treacle elements
have been eliminated from my existence.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> What’s the meaning of that outlandish stuff?
Can’t you speak English?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Yes; I’ve cut the sugar and molasses. In that
line I burned to distinguish myself, but I burnt too much
candy in trying to do it. So my employer requested me to
cut stick.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Sticks of candy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> No, no, myself——leave, varmouse.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Oh! you were discharged.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Yes; I went off and became a policeman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname"><a name="tn_25_Nancy"></a>Nancy.</span></span> A policeman! Simon, I always told you you
would come to some bad end!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Well, the end of my career, in that line, was
rather bad. Ah! but Nancy, you should have seen me in
my uniform, brass buttons, and shield. You would have
been proud of me, had you seen me on my beat with my billy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Billy who?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Ignorant female! My weapon of defence; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
stick with which I terrified old apple-women and young news-boys.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Why didn’t you show yourself? I don’t think you
needed any <i>other</i> stick to frighten them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Nancy, I was a hero on parade; but when it
came to stepping into a row, I must say I felt more like
knocking under than knocking over. In fact, my conscience
became very tender on that point, one night, on having my
billy taken away from me by a burly butcher, and being impressed,
yes, several times impressed, with its hardness as he
whacked me over the head with it. The situation struck me
so forcibly, to say nothing of the billy, I quietly resigned my
office, and retired to the humble but more healthy walks of
life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Well, Mr. Stone, what next?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Mr. Stone! Nancy, don’t be hard on me; call
me Simon, <i>pure</i> Simon, <i>simple</i> Simon. Do! O Nancy!
you are my life, my love! Do come to my arms! (<i>Advances
with arms extended.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>advances duster as before</i>).</span> Stand back! I prefer
my own arms!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>spits and sputters</i>).</span> Ah-choh! You’ll smother
me with dust!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Then behave yourself. Go on with your next
occupation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> It is that honorable profession in which our first
great ancestor won renown.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> By sticking to it,——which you will never do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> And yet, for love of you, cruel Nancy, I’ve
sought this lowly occupation. The Lady of Lyons inspired
me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Who’s she? One of the candy-girls?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Candy-girls? Nancy, have you forgotten the
play?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Oh! she was the young woman in spangles,
that went in among the lions at the menagerie. Pretty lady
she was.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Nancy, I blush for you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Well, I blushed for her. She had no chance
herself, with such daubs on her face.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Nancy, you’re wrong. “The Lady of Lyons”
is a play in which a gardener, Claude——somebody, falls in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
love with a beautiful lady. I went to see it, Nancy; and the
way that young feller made love was amazing. You’d never
believe he knew anything about rutabagas and cabbages.
It give me an idea, Nancy. Says I, Simon, woo Nancy in
that particular metre when you meet her, and victory is
yours. (<i>Strikes an attitude.</i>) “Nancy, I mean Pauline,
bright angels have fallen ere thy time——”</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> What! you saucy scamp! (<i>Chasing him round
table, beating him with brush.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Stop! Don’t! Quit! Nancy, that’s what the
feller said in the play——Claude, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Don’t you ever use such language as that to me,
if you do I’ll scald you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Now don’t let you and I get into hot water because
we are under the same roof. You shall have the
prettiest flowers, Nancy, in the garden, if you’ll only smile
upon me. O Nancy! (<i>Strikes attitude.</i>) “If thou wouldst
have me paint the home——”</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Paint! are you going to be a painter now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> No, Nancy, that’s what Claude said.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Bother Claude! stick to your gardening. Do
that for six months, Simon, and I’ll marry you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Will you, though? then I’ll stick to it forever.
Nancy, seal the bargain with a kiss. (<i>Advances.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>presenting brush as before</i>).</span> Some other time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span></span> (<i>shaking his head, and walking off</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>without
touching brush</i>). Thou <i>dust</i> not tempt me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Now, Simon, quit your nonsense and tell me,
where’s Marcus Graves?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> The young man has gone West.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> And you know nothing about him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Haven’t heard a word from him. By the by,
Nancy, who’s the gent that sticks so close to Miss Bessie?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> You’d never guess, Simon; that’s the very identical
tramp that stopped here six months ago,——the very day
you called——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Yes, washing-day. Well, Nancy, you must have
given him a scrubbing. It seems to me he had something
to do with Marc’s sudden departure.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Everything. He denounced him as a defaulter;
and, on his account, Mr. Manning turned Marcus Graves out
of his house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Indeed!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Yes. You see he was Mr. Manning’s comrade
in the war! and he thinks the world of him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> And he accused Marc, the noblest fellow in the
world. I’d like to get even with him for that. Is he married?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> No; but I shouldn’t wonder if he and Miss
Bessie made a match of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Poor Marc! What’s the fellow’s name?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Matt Winsor.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Matt! Matt! Stop a moment! (<i>Takes memorandum
book from his pocket, and turns the leaves rapidly.</i>)
H. I. J. K. L. M. Here it is——Matt Winsor. Ha! ha!
ho! ho! He’s mine! He’s mine!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> And what’s all that, Simon?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>strikes book</i>).</span> That, Nancy, is my savings bank.
Little bits of information that I picked up as a policeman,
and preserved for future use. Nancy, look at me! I’m
going to astonish you. So the tramp’s sweet on Miss Bessie,
is he? Nancy, I’ll astonish him. Ay, the whole world shall
be astonished. (<i>Strikes attitude, and spouts.</i>)</p>

<p>“And thou, Pauline, so wildly loved, so guiltily betrayed——all
is not lost. If I live, the name of him thou hast once
loved shall not be dishonored; if I die amidst the carnage
and the roar of battle, my soul shall fly back to thee.” (<i>Approaches
her as before.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>advances brush as before; he runs upon it</i>).</span>
What are you talking about?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span></span> (<i>sputtering.</i>) Pooh! Pah! That’s what he said,——Claude,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Hang Claude!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Hush! (<i>Looks around.</i>) Nancy, can you keep
a secret?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Try me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Without opening your lips?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Try me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span></span> (<i>throws his arm about her, prisoning her arms.</i>)
There, keep that, Nancy. (<i>Kisses her, and runs up</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>fiercely</i>).</span> You horrid wretch! (<i>Chases him up

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>coming down wiping her mouth</i>).</span> Well, this is a
new business to him, and I hope he’ll stick to it.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="allsmcap">I. E. R.</span> <i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">May</span> <i>Door</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> What can keep Bess so long? She went off
riding with Matt two hours ago. She seems very fond of
him. (<i>Goes up to door, looks off, and returns</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>) I don’t like
that. For Roy’s sake I have endeavored to make this man’s
stay with us pleasant, and though I can never forget his
rough introduction, I have no reason to complain of his
conduct since. He is gentle and obliging, has not tasted a
drop of liquor since that day, and in every way shown himself
to be at heart a gentleman. (<i>Sits in chair</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>of table.</i>)
And yet I have some good reasons for complaint. He
claims so much of Roy’s time. The hours he spent with
me here are now given to Matt, smoking in the garden, fighting
their battles over again, I dare say. I’m afraid I’m a
little jealous of that; and then his fondness for Bess, and
her fondness for him. Ah! there’s grave cause for anxiety
there. Roy laughs at me when I speak of it; but suppose
they should fall in love with each other? Roy says he’s
much older than she. He forgets there is almost as much
difference in our ages as there is in theirs. I don’t like it.
I believe Roy would be pleased to have them marry; but not
I. No! no! Oh, if Marcus Graves would only return!</p>

<p>Bess (<i>outside</i>). Ha! ha! ha! fairly beaten. Victory,
victory (<i>runs in</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> <i>down</i> <span class="allsmcap"><a name="tn_29_R"></a>R.</span>). Oh, May! such a glorious
victory. I’ve distanced the bold cavalryman on a clear
stretch of five miles. Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Matt.</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Cleverly done, little one. I tried my best, but
for once, you have fairly beaten me. Ah, Roy’s wife,——the
little one is a capital horseman. If ever I go to war again
she shall be enlisted in the same company.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Not I. There’s better company at home. Only
think of it; Roger beat Rollo, fairly outstripped him. He
never did such a thing before.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> The gallant fellow knew the soft caress of a
pretty little hand, would reward his efforts. Who wouldn’t
do his best for that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> And the other gallant fellow was too polite to
snatch victory from those pretty hands.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> No, no. No favor was shown.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Not a bit. You should have heard our cavalryman
shout, and seen him ply the whip. Mercy! I thought a
troop of horse was coming down upon me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Yes, I was a little noisy I confess. For a
moment the old feeling was upon me. The swift pace, made
my blood whirl. I saw before me not you, brave little <a name="tn_30_one"></a>one,
but the enemy, in line of battle; the roars of cannon filled my
ears, the smoke of battle my nostrils. The old cry came to
my lips. Down on them! Death to the foe! Charge.
(<i>Goes</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess</span> (<i>comes to</i> <span class="allsmcap"><a name="tn_30_C"></a>C.</span>).</span> Goodness, gracious! what a noise.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> I beg your pardon; I hope I didn’t swear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Make your mind easy, with the discharge of that
terrific “charge;” there could be need for nothing more explosive.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Ah, well, it’s hard for a dog to forget his old
tricks. I wish I could mine. I’m a rough fellow at the
best. It’s a new life for me, this quiet home, you so kind
and friendly, Roy’s friendship,——No, no; that’s not new.
Heaven bless him: he’s the same old comrade of the battle
days. I know I must be in the way here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> You are the best old fellow in the world (<i>gives

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Love <i>me</i>?</p>

a confession: make the most of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> I wish I deserved it, little one; but it makes me
(<i>wiping eyes</i>) very——that is——its——too much. (<i>Aside.</i>) Confound
it, I shall blubber (<i>Aloud.</i>) Any news of Roy, Mrs.
May?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> No: I hoped you might have been to the office.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> To be sure, and I galloping after this young
Will-o’-the-Wisp. Oh, it’s shameful, but I’ll go at once. If
we only have Roy back what a jolly day this will be. You
shan’t wait long, Roy’s wife. Good-bye little one. (<i>Goes

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Eh? Hasn’t he forgotten me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> I think not. At any time we may have news of
him. You know Roy is now seeking him, for your sake.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> He’s very kind. (<i>Aside.</i>) Now what’s the matter

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> And this man, Matt Winsor, caused his dismissal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Suppose he should never return?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Well, then, I should try and make the best of it.</p>

Bess is happy at his side; even Nancy, the man hater, almost

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> No, everything is flourishing there: I’ve weeded

wrong here in the house.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> In the house,——what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Mrs. Manning, gardening has not been the sole
occupation of my life. Before I entered your service I was
a policeman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Now, a policeman picks up a great many things in
the course of his experience, and, in my short career, I have
gained a morsel of information that may be useful to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> I do not understand you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Mrs. Manning, I was a short time ago, one of the
humble instruments that rescued an unfortunate woman from
the beastly brutality of a ruffian. I say one, the other was
my billy. She was a poor fallen creature, who, in a drunken
brawl was cruelly beaten. As I said, <i>we</i> rescued her in an
almost dying <a name="tn_32_condition"></a>condition. She was taken to Belleview hospital.
As this was the only real service I performed during my brief
career, I was interested in her case, and frequently called to
see her. I was told she could not live. In the kindest manner
possible for a policeman, I informed her of the fact. In
return she told me she was a wife and mother, that her
husband still lived.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> I do not understand how this can interest me. I
pity the poor woman. Can I help her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> You can help her to find her husband.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> I?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Yes, for you know him. She gave me his

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Matt Winsor? impossible! he has told me he has

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Then he’s a villain. I have told you all I know.
The woman is dying. Let him know that, and if he denies
her, then——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Why have you told me this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Because he wronged my warm friend Marcus
Graves. Drove him from this house. I want to see him
treated as he treated Marcus.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Enough! you may go. (<i>Simon turns, and goes

goes up to plants, and busies himself trimming them.</i>)
Drive him from this home. My husband’s friend. Wretch,
he deserves no pity. I’ll fling his perfidy in his teeth. He
dare to love Bess? Ah, I have the power to save her.
Heaven be praised.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> For the last time, I am determined.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="charname">Matt</span> <i>runs in</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> No letter, Roy’s wife, and that’s the best news I
could bring. For as he has not written ’tis a proof he’s on
the road home. Dear old boy! How glad we shall all be
to see him. (<i>Pause.</i>) Ah! what’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> When a spy is caught in his enemy’s camp, what
is done with him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> He’s strung to a tree, without judge or jury.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> When a rogue is caught playing the honest man,
in a peaceful and loving family, what should be his fate?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> He should be turned adrift, and shunned forever
more.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Right (<i>rising</i>). You have sentenced yourself.
This house is no longer your home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> No longer——my home;——why——what is this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>rises</i>).</span> Matt Winsor, listen to me. You entered
this house a miserable, drunken vagabond. You were tenderly
cared for, because you were our Roy’s comrade. We
trusted you, confided in you, and you——like a viper——turned
and stung the hand that fed you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> No, no; ’tis false. I have repaid trust with
trust.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Indeed! As you repaid the trust of that poor
woman now dying in Belleview Hospital. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">Bess</span> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)
Your wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt</span> (<i>agitated</i>).</span> My wife——my wife?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Ah! your agitation is confession, and yet you told
me you had no wife. Wretch! you dare not face my husband’s
flashing eye, with this infamy known to him. You
drove a noble fellow away by your accusations. Think you
Roy, who could not bear his presence, will suffer a greater
criminal to rest beneath his roof. And what greater criminal
can there be than he who deserts his wife: his trusting
wife?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Stop, stop, I say. You must not make me hate
you, for you are Roy’s wife. My friend’s wife. Taunt me
not. I will go out into the cold world once more. It’s
only a step, and I am the outcast, the tramp, again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess</span> (<i>runs to</i> <span class="charname">Matt</span>).</span> No, no, you must not go. Roy
will soon return.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Let him face him if he dares. (<i>Goes</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Fear not, I will not face him. I told you, Bess,
I was not wanted here. I have come between man and
wife. A part of the affection which should have been all hers
has gone out to the man who, in auld lang syne, tried to be a
true friend. Let it pass. For all your kindness to me,
accept my thanks. I shall trouble you no more. (<i>Goes up
to</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Oh, Matt! Don’t leave us. (<i>Gives hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt</span> (<i>kissing them</i>).</span> It is right, little one, we have been
very happy, too happy for so poor a wretch as I. Roy’s
wife, hear me before I leave your house. I spoke the truth
to you. I have no wife!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>comes down</i>).</span> That’s a lie, and I can prove it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Ah! this is your work.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> I own it. There’s nothing shabby about me.
(<i>Goes</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>back.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> I spoke the truth. Years ago I went to battle
for my country, leaving at home my wife and child. Oh,
how I loved them, bitterly I knew when returning from my
first campaign, I found my wife had fled with my dearest
friend, leaving our child to the care of strangers, who had
taken her far, far away. In vain I sought her. She was
gone. Oh, Bess, if you have found any tenderness in the
rough soldier’s heart, thank this for it; for out of grace
and gentleness I had fashioned an image of my lost child
which you resembled, little one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Oh, what do I hear?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Heaven bless you. Heaven bless all beneath
this roof; and heaven help the poor wanderer now. (<i>Goes out

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Oh Matt, Matt, stay with us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Matt, Matt, come back. (<i>Cross to</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt</span> (<i>turns in doorway</i>).</span> No; you have driven me out,

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> I thought it my duty, Bess.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Who’s driven out now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>comes down</i>).</span> Matt Winsor; and I did it, Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>runs into his arms</i>).</span> Oh, Roy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Bless you, sweetheart: it’s good to meet you once
again. And Bess bright as ever, give me a kiss.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> A dozen. (<i>Kisses him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> That’s sweet; and, in return, I’ve brought you
something nice.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Good news? (<i>Goes</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Yes: in the original package. Come in Marcus.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Yes; we’ve had excellent luck: just at the last
moment, too. We had about given up in despair when the
excellent but thick-headed senior partner of the concern,
happened to pull out a drawer in the safe, and there, closely
packed behind it was the missing bills. Marcus was a hero,
at once. I had hard work to bring him away; but here he
is. Ah, Nancy, how are you? (<i>Goes</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>and shakes hands

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> And this is my new gardener (<i>shakes hands with

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Splendidly, thank you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>returns to</i> <span class="allsmcap"><a name="tn_36_C"></a>C.</span>).</span> Well, and how has my little wife
spent the dull days?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Trying her best to kill time, and bring this happy
day nearer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Well, I’m rejoiced to find you are well, and Matt——where’s
Matt? He surely should be on hand to give his
comrade a merry welcome. (<i>All stand silent.</i>) How’s
this, where is he? Is he ill?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>with an effort</i>).</span> He is gone, Roy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Gone? what, left the house?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Oh, Roy, he is unworthy of your regard. He has
deceived us. He has a wife living.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Indeed! How did you hear this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> I, sir, was the humble instrument of his exposure.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Oh, you were.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> I was told by a poor, dying woman that he was
her husband, and I thought it my duty to inform Mrs. Manning
of his duplicity. It was a painful duty, sir, but I never
shirk my duty. In that line there’s nothing shabby about
me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Oh! then it’s my duty to inform you that your services
as gardener here, will no longer be required.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Oh! (<i>aside</i>) here’s gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Serves you right, Claude Meddlenot.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> And so poor Matt, in shame, took himself off?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>confused</i>).</span> No——Roy——you’re not quite right
there; for I——I——drove him away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> You,——May;——you drove the man, who once saved
your husband’s life, from his house?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> I,——forgive me, Roy,——I thought I was right.
(<i>Goes towards him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Don’t come near me. Driven my old friend out?
Do you know what that means?——disgrace for him, shame
for me. He will die in the gutter. No, no; it shall not be.
I’ll not eat or sleep until I find him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Oh, Roy, you will not leave me. (<i>Throws herself
upon his neck.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> For his sake, May, yes. Do not hold me. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>

<h2><a name="ACT_III" id="ACT_III"></a>ACT III.</h2>


<p class="hanging"><i>Scene as before. Fire burning in fireplace.</i> <span class="charname">May</span> <i>in armchair
before fire, half turned toward audience, gazing into
the fire. Light on her from fire.</i> <span class="charname">Bess</span> <i>at piano playing,
“’Tis the last rose of summer.”</i> <span class="charname">Marcus</span> <i>has arm on
piano, looking down at her. Study lamp lighted on table</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">L. C.</span> <span class="charname">Roy</span> <i>seated</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>of table reading paper. Curtains at
windows down. Chair</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>of table, as music ceases:——</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Thank you, Bess. “’Tis the last rose of summer,”
to-night we pluck: the last of our delightful courtship,
to be replaced with orange blossoms, fit symbols of the fruits
of happiness, we shall then garner for the future. Ah,
Bess, what blissful days are in store for us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>eyes on paper</i>).</span> Poor devil.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Eh? Did you speak to me, Manning?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Not I. “One more unfortunate” here (<i>tapping
paper</i>). Found dead in a doorway, with an empty bottle
smelling strongly of “laudanum” beside him,——wrapped in
an army overcoat. Ah, so they go. Fighting bravely the
enemy of their country in war, overthrown by the enemy in
peace.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Oh, Roy, could it have been——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> No one we have an interest in, I hope, May.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> I was thinking of——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> One whose name is no more spoken here. I know
to whom you allude, May. It was not him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Then you have news?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> I can give you no tidings of him. When three
months ago I returned from my search, we agreed to forget
him. Let us abide by our compact. It can be no pleasure
to you: ’tis painful to me (<i>rises</i>). When a man forgets all
the obligations of friendship, withholds confidence from his
sworn comrade, and deliberately acts a lie, he no longer
holds a place in honest hearts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Oh, Roy, so bitter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>crossing to her chair</i>).</span> To you, May, I owe it all.
You, with your clear, woman’s vision, pierced the mask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and disclosed the deception (<i>bitterly</i>). I thank you. (<i>Goes
up to window and looks out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Bitter, bitter. I have wounded his dear heart by
my folly. Will he ever forgive me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>comes down</i>).</span> It’s a blustering night. (<i>Rests hand
on back of</i> <span class="charname">May’s</span> <i>chair.</i>) That’s a glorious blaze, May.
Pity I cannot stay and enjoy it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Are you going out?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Not to-night, Roy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus</span></span> (<i>comes down to chair vacated by</i> <span class="charname">Roy</span>, <i>and takes
up paper</i>). “There’s no place like home,” Manning.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Right, Marcus: especially if it’s somebody’s else
home, with a particular attraction in the shape of a pretty
girl. Now, don’t press me to stay, for you know you and
Bess are dying to be alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Gammon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Rather say backgammon, for with two that makes
home a <i>par-o-dice</i>. There’s but one will miss me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Oh, Roy, must you go?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> ’Tis Wednesday night: my evening out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> ’Tis Christmas eve, and to-morrow is——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> The anniversary of our wedding, May. Did you
think I had forgotten that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> No, not forgotten it, Roy, but on the eve of——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Such a glorious anniversary, you think I should
remain at home. No, May, duty calls me,——a religious duty,——which
I would not disregard even for the sake of your dear
company.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Roy, you are withholding confidence from me.
You will not tell me why you go, where you go? Is that
right?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</span> Ha! ha! ha! Inquisitive female. No,
it’s all wrong; but that I may right it I go, and you may
have the blaze all to yourself. Imagine yourself Cinderella
among the embers, and wish the fairy godmother would drop
down the chimney to keep you company. Now tell me what
would be your first request?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> That my husband would have no secrets I could
not share.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> That’s a very sensible request. What next?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> That in our midst, home again, she would place
the wanderer,——your comrade,——Matt Winsor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> May!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> With all my heart I wish it, Roy. That man’s
fate, the possibility of what he may have become, terrifies
me. Think you I cannot feel how that wild act of mine has
shadowed your existence. When he left, driven from your
doors by me, something went out of our happy life, I would
give the world to reclaim.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> May, do you doubt my love for you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> No, no; not that Roy. Not one look of reproach:
not one word, for what I have done, ever tender, thoughtful,
patient. Oh, Roy, I do not deserve it. (<i>Covers face with
hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> May, you shall know all (<i>walks to table</i>). No, no,
the secret is not mine. I must be patient; she must suffer.
(<i>Marcus looks up at him from paper</i>). Well, what’s the
matter with you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Manning, old fellow, I’m afraid you’re going
over to the enemy. (<span class="charname">Bess</span> <i>comes down back of table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> It’s about time, when the enemy——as you style her——is
a sweet, little woman, stung with remorse, and the attacking
forces men, strong men, who ought to be ashamed
of themselves: I don’t like it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Then strike your flag at once. There’s only
one thing to prevent it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Your promise.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> What in the world are you talking about——you
two?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>turning away</i>).</span> Bah! that girl would break up a
council of war, with her sharp ears and inquisitive tongue.
(<i>Goes over to</i> <span class="charname">May’s</span> <i>chair.</i> <span class="charname">Bess</span> <i>talks with Marcus in dumb
show.</i>) Look up, May. I must go; but this night shall be
the last. Before you sleep you shall know all, and I will
ask forgiveness for my cruelty. Come, get my coat: that’s
a dear. Time flies. I must be off.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span></span> (<i>rising.</i>) You will return early?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> As I always do. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="charname">May</span>, <i>door</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, <span class="charname">Roy</span>, <i>hand
on back of armchair watches her off.</i>) ’Tis a hard lesson,
wife of mine, but through the tears, I see the smile, and
behind the clouds, the sunlight, that shall bring lasting peace
forevermore. Halloa, you two whispering? I don’t like
that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Third parties seldom do. I like it: that’s enough.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> And so does Marcus. He looks as happy as
though to-morrow were to be a holiday for him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> ’Twill be a holy day, for us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> You’re to be married, to-morrow: to be enslaved.
Ah, what will become of you two?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> We two will become one, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Yes, the sum total of my bliss will be a unit.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> How you <i>cypher</i> that. Matrimonial figuring by
addition makes two one, subtracts sweets from added blessings,
and multiplies comforts by dividing labors. That’s the
slate from which nothing can be wiped, but by fractures.
Well bless you my children. I hope you will be as happy as
May and I, and never quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> And have no secrets——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Ahem! (<i><a name="tn_41_Aside"></a>Aside.</i>) From you, impossible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> And have no going out of nights. Hey, Marcus.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Most certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> <a name="tn_41_Hark"></a>“Hark, from the <i>graves</i> a doleful sound.” Charity
calls me out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Charity begins at home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> And ends there; but if it be true, it’s line of duty,
between the beginning and the ending, describes a circle
that, like the equator, embraces the whole world.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> That’s very good, Manning.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> But you’ve no right to break the home circle, and
leave your poor wife here alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Alone? Nonsense! when she has you and Marcus
to amuse her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Oh, we’re going to have a game of billiards.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Billiards, a <i>cue</i>rious game for lovers. But there’s
lots of “kisses” in it. Hey, Bess?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Oh, I could scratch you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> I’ll have a “run” before you do. Here’s May.
(<i>Enter door</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>with</i> <span class="charname">Roy’s</span> <i>coat and hat.</i>) Thank you.
(<i>Takes coat and puts it on.</i>) You won’t be lonesome?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> No, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span></span> (<i>takes hat from her.</i>) That’s right. Bess and Marcus
are going to play billiards. You don’t play, you know;
but you can count.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Yes; (<i>aside</i>) one too many.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Of course; (<i>aside</i>) and spoil the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> I’ve been giving the young people a lesson on
charity. Bess believes it begins at home, and now she has
an excellent opportunity to prove her theory, by forgetting
that “two is company, and three is none.” Good-bye.
(<i>Kisses</i> <span class="charname">May</span>, <i>and exits</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> <span class="charname">May</span> <i>follows him to door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>turns back and stops</i> <span class="allsmcap"><a name="tn_42_C"></a>C.</span>).</span> I shall know all to-night.
He said it. I am content. I doubt not I shall laugh at my
folly, when I know the truth: only a little shadow flung
across the brightness of our home, so hard to bear? Heaven
pity those to whom the sunlight never comes. (<i>Exit door</i> <span class="allsmcap">L</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess</span> (<i>feebly</i>).</span> May, May, you’re not going? (<i>Louder.</i>)
Why, Marcus, she didn’t hear me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> No wonder; the call was very faint. I’ll call
her. (<i>Rises and goes to door</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess</span></span> (<i>runs up and brings him down</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>) No, no. I don’t
think she cares for company.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus</span> (<i>putting his arm around her waist</i>).</span> I’m sure
we do not, Bess.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Marcus, what do you suppose sent Roy out to-night?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Well, I think I could guess.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Oh, you could. Isn’t that splendid? Tell me,
quick.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Ah! but it’s a secret.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname"><a name="tn_42_Bess"></a>Bess.</span></span> Oh, dear! now you are beginning to be mysterious.
Remember sir: we are to have no secrets.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Quite right; and as you are not to learn this,
we shall have no secrets still——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess</span> (<i>pouting</i>).</span> Marcus, you’re as bad as Roy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> If I am no worse than that estimable man, then
you will receive a treasure to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Take care, sir: “there’s many a slip ’twixt the cup
and the lip.”</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Don’t be alarmed: you shall have the treasure,
Bess. Never mind the cup; the lips will satisfy me (<i>kisses
her</i>) now, and to-morrow my cup of happiness will be full.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Ah! but I may change my mind before to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Twenty times, if you like? but to-morrow you
will only change——your name.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> And my dress. You haven’t asked me what I am
to be married in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> I know,——in church.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Oh, provoking! have you no curiosity to know
how your bride will look?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> I know you will look lovely. Let others admire
the setting, I shall have eyes only for the jewel. Come,
a game of billiards. (<i>Goes to table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Shall I call May?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> No, I’ll call Nancy (<i>strikes bell on table</i>) to
light the billiard room. May will find us when she needs us.
(<i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">Nancy</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R. I. E.</span>) Nancy, be kind enough to light
the billiard room, will you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> My gracious! you’re not going to play billiards,
to-night?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess</span> (<span class="allsmcap">R. C.</span>).</span> And why not, Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> And going to be married, to-morrow? (<i>Crosses
stage to</i> <span class="allsmcap">I. E. L.</span>) Well, I never! Better be preparing your
minds with something solemn. The book of Job, now, will
prepare you for trials, and there’s a heap of comfort, at such
times, in the book of Revelations. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="allsmcap">I. E. L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Well, our good Nancy takes rather a gloomy
view of marriage?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Yes, poor thing; she’s no such happiness to look
forward to. I think she’s a little ashamed of her conduct to
Simon Stone. He’s not been near her for three months.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Since he threw up gardening, on so short a
trial. But Simon loves her still, I’m sure. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">Simon</span>,
<span class="allsmcap">C.</span>) He’ll turn up in good time. There’s nothing shabby
about Simon Stone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> You may bet your bottom dollar on that, every
time. How are you Mark?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Holloa! speak of the——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Don’t mention him (<i>gives hand</i>): we can’t say
any good of him. (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="charname">Bess</span>.) Miss Bess, your most
obedient (<i>bows</i>), allow me, in feeble words, but heartfelt
gush, to congratulate you and Mark on the happiest day of
your life,——to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Oh, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>presenting box</i>).</span> With hopes and wishes, for
loaves and fishes: that is, prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Thank you (<i>opens box</i>). Diamonds? Oh, Mr.
Stone, you are too generous. (<i>Comes to</i> <span class="charname">Mark</span> <i>at table: he

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Why, Si! old fellow, this is a princely gift.
What is your calling, now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> My what is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Your trade?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Bother trade! Don’t speak of it. I’m above all
that, you know. I’m in the Ring now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> The Circus Ring?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Do I look like an acrobat?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> The Prize Ring?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Prize humbug! Do I look like a bruiser? No,
Mark: I’m a member of one of those mysterious rings, you
know, which surround the government, keep it in its place,
without which this glorious union would go to smash.
Where’s Mr. Manning? I must see him at once.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> He’s out, but will soon return.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Then I will wait.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Look here, Simon, it’s rather queer that you
want to see Mr. Manning. I should say Nancy would suit
you better.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Nancy?——what Nancy?——which Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Nancy Nipper, to be sure: have you forgotten her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Oh——ah——yes——yes, I remember there was a
young thing, rather smart, somewhat attractive, about here;
but when one gets into “rings,” hob-nobbing with senators
and nabobs, one forgets these (<i>snaps fingers</i>) these little
trifles. Nancy? yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Well, I’m rather glad to know that you are not
in pursuit of her this time, for, between you and me, Nancy
has a chance to make a good match now, with one who is
dying for her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>excitedly</i>).</span> You don’t mean it! Dying is he? I’ll
finish him! After Nancy——my Nancy! Who is he?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Ha! ha! ha! he’s a man who’s got above trade,
you know: a member of one of those mysterious rings, you
understand. Ha! ha! ha! Si,——old fellow,——it won’t do: I
can read you. You’re on the old trail. (<i>Comes to</i> <span class="allsmcap">I. E. L.</span>)
Come, Bess.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Oblige me by making yourself comfortable, Mr.
Stone. (<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="charname">Marcus</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Yes; and forget those (<i>snaps fingers</i>) little
trifles. Ha! ha! ha! (<span class="charname">Bess</span> <i>and</i> <span class="charname">Marcus</span> <i>exit</i> <span class="allsmcap">I. E. L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>stands</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> <i>looking after them</i>).</span> Ha! ha! ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
(<i>mockingly</i>)! I’m on the old trail, am I? Can’t pull wool
over his eyes. He’s right. Nancy is the <i>dear</i> I’m hunting:
the Nipper that will satisfy my thirsty spirit. They do say
money is one of the sinews of war, the strongest and the
mightiest to win. If that’s so, I’m on my muscle. That’s a
glorious old blaze. Simon, make yourself comfortable (<i>sits in
arm chair</i>). She told me to, and when a pretty girl asks a favor,
there’s nothing shabby about me. (<i>Sits before fire, warming
his hands, chair with back to</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">Nancy</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L. I. E.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> I declare, I’m mortified. To see that couple
billing and cooing, and she a little thing, who’s only just left
her dolls, a-going to be married, and I scrubbing along in
single blessedness, because I hadn’t the sense to take Simon
Stone when I had the chance. Plague take the fellow! no
doubt he’s given me up, when if he had only stuck to it he
might have seen (<i>crosses to fireplace</i>), with half an eye, I was
dying to throw myself (<i>seizes back of</i> <span class="charname">Simon’s</span> <i>chair, whirls
it round, and bounces into his lap, as she speaks this</i>) into
his arms. (<i>Screams, jumps up, and runs</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>) Mercy sakes!
who’s that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Needn’t rise on my account, Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> What?——no——yes——it is. Why, Simon?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Why Simon? because I was christened so, I
’spose, Nancy. Well, how are you? You see I’m down
here on a little business with Mr. Manning. Didn’t think
of seeing you. ’Sposed you must be married and settled
before this, Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Do you mean to say that you are not here on
purpose to see me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> You don’t suppose a fellow is made of <i>injy</i> rubber,
to bounce up after he’s been thrown, and run after the
same girl that bounced him, do you? No, Nancy; when
I quit gardening so suddenly, I made up my mind that
chasing you was not a business that would pay to stick to.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Good riddance, Mr. Stone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Thank you, Nancy. Just at that point in my
hitherto unfortunate career, Uncle Brim died, and left me a
legacy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Who’s Uncle Brim?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Uncle Brimer Stone. We called him Brim, for
short——Brim Stone; pretty good name for him, for he was
a regular old Satan,——well, he left me a thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> A thousand dollars?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Exactly. Now, says I, Simon, you’ve been a rolling
stone long enough. You’ve got a nest egg: sit still,
and see what will come of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Well, what did?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Calker Goodwin, the broker, came and wanted
to borrow it: a genial fellow after he found I had the money,
though he did cut me a week before; but then legacies, like
death, level all distinctions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> And you let him have it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> No; declined with thanks, as the editors tell the
poets. Then he told me of a good investment. “The Iris.”</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Irish what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> “The Iris,”——a silver mine,——somewhere or nowhere,
it don’t matter which. The stock was way down:
eighty cents. Cal said it would rise in three days: bade
me go in and win. So in I went, invested my thousand in
Iris, and in three days it was way up to ten dollars, in three
weeks to forty; then I got scared.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Scared?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Yes; the thing looked too big. I said to myself,
some poor fellow will get into this, ’twill bust and up goes
his all. And then I’d been reading about rich men’s not being
able to enter the eye of a camel, you know; and says I, I’ll
be no party to any such business. There’s nothing shabby
about me. I’ll sell out. Sold the next day at forty, and
three days after the Iris was all in my eye: it busted.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname"><a name="tn_46_Nancy"></a>Nancy.</span></span> But you didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> No, Nancy; I made forty thousand dollars. I’ve
got it now, and it’s the thing I mean to stick to——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Why, Simon, you’re a rich man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Oh, so-so, so-so. You wait until we get our railroad,
though.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Our railroad?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> That’s one of my rings. I’m in lots of ’em.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Where does this railroad run?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Into my pockets, if government will help it.
You see it’s not laid out yet, but the papers are in proper
trim for a grant.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Grant! what’s he got to do with it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Oh, you’re simple, you are: it’s no use to talk to
you of these great schemes. Can I do anything for you, <a name="tn_46_Nancy_question"></a>Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Well, I’m not proud, Nancy; and when I look at
you, the memory of departed days is strong upon me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>tenderly</i>).</span> O, Simon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> And if there’s any young man you want to boost
into a business that would suit you——</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>sternly</i>).</span> Simon!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> I’d like to help him to a start. I can’t forget
your helping me to a good many.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>fiercely</i>).</span> Simon Stone! you’re just as hateful
as you can be. You’ve got money, and now come here to
put on airs before me. I knew you when you didn’t know
where the next meal was coming from: when you hadn’t a
whole rag to your back. Keep your money, and make the
best of it. I’ll have nothing more to do with you. (<i>Crosses
to</i> <span class="allsmcap">R. I. E.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Where are you going, Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> To the kitchen, where I belong. I’m no fit
associate for a member of the ring.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>rising</i>).</span> Then I’ll go too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Indeed! a dirty kitchen is no place for a member
of the ring. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="allsmcap">R. I. E.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> They’re in all kinds of dirty business <a name="tn_47_anyhow"></a>anyhow.
Don’t think, then, that will prevent me. Well, I’ve made
her about as mad as I dare. She’s a smart girl, Nancy <a name="tn_47_is"></a>is,
and she’ll find that, with or without money, there’s nothing

I threw myself upon the bed. Such a horrid dream.
Where are they all? (<i>Looks off</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>) There’s a light in
the billiard room, and Marcus and Bess are there. I’ll
go to them (<i>goes to</i> <span class="allsmcap">I. E. L.</span>). No, how happy they look;
I should be in the way. Dear Bess; to-morrow takes her
from me, and gives her to another. May she be happy!
She will never know my foolish fears for her made so much
mischief. (<i>Goes slowly to chair at fireplace, stands with her
hand on back of it, looking into fire.</i>) And to-night I shall
know all. Ah, Roy, my husband, you know not how those
simple words comfort me. In their fulfilment I feel there is
a power to lift a burden hard to bear. (<i>Sits in chair, half

I thought he appeared before me in all his rags, as once he

as then, the same drunken look in his eyes. (<span class="charname">Matt</span> <i>staggers

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Oh yes, yes, you are very welcome: we have

how sorry I am for the wrong I did you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> No such thing (<i><a name="tn_48_hic3"></a>hic</i>): you did me no wrong. I
de (<i><a name="tn_48_hic4"></a>hic</i>) ceived you, and you turned me out like a dog——a
stray dog——just what I was. What right had I ’mong
hones’ folks.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> The right every man has to recognition when he
attempts to shake off the shackles of habit, and be a man
again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Jes’ so; but you see it’s no use (<i><a name="tn_48_hic5"></a>hic</i>). I fell

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> O Matt——Roy’s comrade——tell me you forgive
me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Well, you lis (<i><a name="tn_48_hic6"></a>hic</i>) ’n to me. You told me to go
to my wife——my deserted wife (<i><a name="tn_48_hic7"></a>hic</i>). I went; she died in
my arms. (<i>Serious, forgetting himself.</i>) Poor woman! she
had fallen by the way. I couldn’t raise her, but I did the
best I could; I made a pillow of the breast where beat a
heart that once was all hers. She died there: died like a
child sinking to rest. (<i>Weeps.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>surprised</i>).</span> Why, Matt!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt</span> (<i>quickly assuming drunken manner</i>).</span> Well (<i><a name="tn_48_hic8"></a>hic</i>),
she died——she did. Poor Mary Randall!</p>

husband and father (<i><a name="tn_49_hic2"></a>hic</i>) long ago.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> A father?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Yes, I went to war, left them in a happy home;
came back in a year to find the mother flown, the child (<i><a name="tn_49_hic3"></a>hic</i>)
gone with strangers. Then I went——I went to battle again
to sell my life cheap (<i><a name="tn_49_hic4"></a>hic</i>); no use, I couldn’t die. I changed
my name——the name she had disgraced——and met Roy.
You know the rest (<i><a name="tn_49_hic5"></a>hic</i>). It’s only a tramp’s story (<i><a name="tn_49_hic6"></a>hic</i>).
Who cares for him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> But the child?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Oh, I’ve found her (<i><a name="tn_49_hic7"></a>hic</i>): she’s all right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Thank heaven! my fears are groundless.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Yes, I found her, indeed, happy: a child to be
proud of; but how could I face her (<i><a name="tn_49_hic8"></a>hic</i>)? I, a drunkard and
a tramp.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Oh, she would forgive everything: run into your
arms, and weep with joy upon your breast.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt</span> (<i>rises.</i>)</span> Would you do that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> I?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Would you, surrounded by luxury and comfort,
happy in the love of a kind husband, would you take that
man to your heart, present him to your husband?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>rises</i>).</span> I?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Yes, you: May Manning,——once May Randall——you
who turned me from your doors——ponder well; for
all the wretchedness and shame that clings to me, is part and
parcel of——your father.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Ah! (<i>Staggers to table and falls into chair</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>of
it, her face on her arm on table.</i> <span class="charname">Matt</span> <i>passes to back of
chair at fireplace, and with hand upon it looks at her.</i>) I
have told you the truth. As I am, I have come to you, the
father to his child. I go. If you, remembering what I am,
what I have been, and what I may yet become, desire my
presence, seek me. If you would escape the shame which
must come with the exposure, forget me, and my lips are
closed forever. (<i>Looks at her tenderly, opens his arms, and
is about to step towards her, stops, shakes his head, and
steals out door</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> 3d <span class="allsmcap">E.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span></span> (<i>after a short pause raises her head, and falls back
in chair</i>). Oh, shame! misery! disgrace! I, that could not
warmly greet my husband’s comrade when he came, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of pride; who turned him from these doors, jealous of the
kindly heart that turned to him, have found my punishment
at last. “If you would escape the shame,” he said, “forget
me.” (<i>Rises.</i>) My father? no! no! Come shame, come disgrace,
the wanderer shall find rest, the father find a champion
in his daughter’s love. (<i>Goes</i> <span class="allsmcap"><a name="tn_50_L"></a>L.</span> <i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">Roy</span> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Ah, my darling. You see I’ve kept my word.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>runs up and throws herself on his breast</i>, <span class="allsmcap"><a name="tn_50_C"></a>C.</span>).</span> O
Roy, Roy, never so welcome. O Roy, I am so happy.
(<i><a name="tn_50_Weeps"></a>Weeps.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Well, well, little wife, tears are not signs of happiness.
Let me get off my coat. (<span class="charname">May</span> <i>turns and comes to
table.</i> <span class="charname">Roy</span> <i>removes coat and throws hat and coat on ottoman,
then comes down to chair at fireplace, and watches her,
hand on back of it</i>. <span class="charname">May</span> <i>stands at table looking down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>aside</i>).</span> She bears it bravely. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, May,
now for my promise: to tell you the mighty secret.
(<i>Comes toward her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> No, Roy, hear me first. (<i>Falls on her knees.</i>)
Hear my confession. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">Bess</span> <i>and</i> <span class="charname">Marcus</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L. I. E.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy</span> (<i>quickly raising her</i>).</span> Hush, wife! listeners.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>steps back in line with door</i>, 3 <span class="allsmcap">E. <a name="tn_50_R"></a>R.</span>).</span> I care not:
hear it all. (<span class="charname">Roy</span> <i>goes to mantel.</i>) One whom I thought
dead, one whom my mother wronged, comes now in want
and wretchedness, not to claim my duty as he has a right, but
with a nobleness that puts to shame my pride, to seal his
lips, that, with a word, could make me blush before the world.
Do you hear me, Roy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> I am listening, May.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Then seek him. It may be in dens of vice,
among the fallen and debased; but seek him, and when you
find him say, I wait with loving heart to greet him home,——his
home for evermore.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">Matt</span>, <i>door</i> 3. <span class="allsmcap">E. R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> You need not seek him: he’s here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May</span> (<i>throwing herself into his arms</i>).</span> My father!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> My child! My dear, dear daughter!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Roy, you hear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Yes: I’ve heard too much. The weighty secret is
out at last. Matt, old fellow, you organized this campaign:
after your treatment here, you have a right to revenge; but
to me it has been a meaner battle than ever I hoped to engage
in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> ’Twas but to test a daughter’s love, Roy. “All’s
fair in love and war.”</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Then <i>you</i> have been deceiving me. O Roy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> I couldn’t help it. ’Twas Matt’s work: we’ve all
been engaged in it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Marcus.</span></span> Yes: all of us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> Well, I never; it’s the first I’ve heard of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> It’s the first time, then, your ears have been off
duty.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Bess.</span></span> They’re not trained to secret service. (<i>Runs up
to</i> <span class="charname">Matt</span>.) O Matt, I’m so glad to get you back. (<i>Shakes
hands with him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span></span> (<i>outside</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>) Come along, Nancy, I’ll make it all
right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Ah, who have we here?</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="charname">Simon</span> <i>and</i> <span class="charname">Nancy</span>, <i>arm in arm</i> <span class="allsmcap">R. I. E.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Mr. Manning, I came down here as a bearer of
dispatches.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Ah, for me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> To you; but not for you. (<i>Steps up to</i> <span class="charname">Matt</span>.)
Mr. Randall, I was guilty of a mean act towards you once.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt</span> (<i>gives hand</i>).</span> Never mind, Simon: you’ve been a
good friend since.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Well, but I do mind: it weighed upon me. I
don’t like to be shabby, and so, as I’m in the ring, I’m bound
to wipe that out (<i>gives packet</i>). There, sir, is a commission
as postmaster; it’s a good one. I’ve influence, you know.
If you don’t like it, and want something better, just say so;
I’ll fix it for you, for I’m in the ring——in the ring. (<i>Struts
down to</i> <span class="charname">Nancy</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> You told me you’d have nothing more to do
with rings.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> Did I? Well, I’ll keep my word; but there’s
one more ring we can’t do without. (<i>Takes ring from his
pocket and puts it on her finger.</i>) This, for instance, is our
engagement ring.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy.</span></span> Why, it’s a diamond, Simon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon.</span></span> It is, Nancy——a buster. This shall be followed
by the wedding ring, and then the teething ring.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Nancy</span> (<i>claps hand over his mouth</i>).</span> Simon Stone!</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Simon</span> (<i>takes her hand and draws it through his arm</i>).</span>
You shall have them all, Nancy. There’s nothing shabby
about me. (<span class="charname">Roy</span> <i>goes up to</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="charname">May</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Roy.</span></span> Well, little wife, are you satisfied?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> Can you ask it, Roy? (<i>Gives him</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">Matt.</span></span> Ah, old fellow, the dear one was hardly pressed;
she fought bravely, and won a peaceful victory. To her be
all the glory.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><span class="charname">May.</span></span> She has stepped between the comrades of old days
only, I trust, to be the link that binds them closer. (<i>Gives</i>
<span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>hand to</i> <span class="charname">Matt</span>.) Hereafter, in the battle of life, we three
march in line, joy and sorrow, victory and defeat, to one, to
all. Comrades in prosperity, comrades in adversity, ever
true, sworn comrades.</p>
